1. Play around with twitch. Identify important components and their classes. Think about how to select all the channel elements you need to select.
2. What do I need in order to execute some javascript on the page?
3. Chrome extension, bookmarklet, firefox extension? Which to pick, does it matter which one.
4. Mess around with iframe elements. That's how twitch shows their streams.
...that's good enough for now.
